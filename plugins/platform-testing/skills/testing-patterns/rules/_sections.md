## 1. Philosophy (philosophy)

**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Testing is about confidence, not coverage. Focus on behavior, test at the right level, and prioritize integration tests.

## 2. Test Structure (test)

**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Well-structured tests are readable, maintainable, and reliable. AAA pattern, isolation, clear naming.

## 3. Mocking (mock)

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Mock external boundaries, not your own code. Strategic mocking enables fast, reliable tests without sacrificing confidence.

## 4. Coverage (coverage)

**Impact:** LOW
**Description:** Coverage is a tool, not a goal. Use it to find untested code, but don't chase percentages.
