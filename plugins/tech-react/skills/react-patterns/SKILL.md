# React Patterns

React-specific best practices. These rules build on the generic `platform-frontend` plugin with React-specific APIs.

## When This Applies

- React in dependencies
- Building React components
- Using React hooks

## Extends

This plugin extends **`platform-frontend`** (generic frontend patterns). Apply those rules first, then these React-specific ones.

## Quick Reference

| Section | Impact | Prefix |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Hooks | HIGH | `hooks-` |
| Effects | HIGH | `effect-` |
| Components | MEDIUM | `component-` |
| Performance | MEDIUM | `perf-` |

## Rules

See `rules/` directory for individual rules organized by section prefix.
