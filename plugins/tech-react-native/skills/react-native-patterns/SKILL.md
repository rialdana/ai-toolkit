# React Native Patterns

React Native-specific best practices, primarily using Expo.

## When This Applies

- Building React Native applications
- Using Expo
- Native module integration

## Extends

This plugin extends:
- **`platform-mobile`** (generic mobile patterns)
- **`tech-react`** (React patterns for components and hooks)

Apply those rules first, then these React Native-specific ones.

## Quick Reference

| Section | Impact | Prefix |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Expo | HIGH | `expo-` |
| Navigation | HIGH | `nav-` |
| Native | MEDIUM | `native-` |

## Status

**Scaffold** - Sections defined, rules to be added.

## Rules

See `rules/` directory for individual rules organized by section prefix.
