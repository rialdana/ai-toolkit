# iOS Development Patterns

General iOS and Swift development patterns. For specialized areas, see:

- **Swift Concurrency**: Use the `swift-concurrency` skill for async/await, actors, tasks, and Sendable patterns
- **Liquid Glass Design**: Use the `liquid-glass-ios` skill for iOS 26+ glassEffect UI patterns

This skill provides general iOS development guidance and extends the `platform-mobile` skill with iOS-specific patterns.

## Status

Scaffold — specialized patterns moved to dedicated skills (swift-concurrency, liquid-glass-ios). Contribute general iOS patterns to `references/` as needed.
