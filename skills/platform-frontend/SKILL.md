# Principles

- Start with local state — lift only when shared
- Organize code by feature, not by type
- Use named exports for better refactoring and searchability
- Never use barrel files (index.ts re-exports) — they break tree-shaking and slow builds
- Measure before memoizing — don't optimize what isn't slow

# Rules

See [rules index](rules/_sections.md) for detailed patterns.

## Examples

### Positive Trigger

User: "Choose state boundaries and data-fetching patterns for this web app."

Expected behavior: Use `platform-frontend` guidance, follow its workflow, and return actionable output.

### Non-Trigger

User: "Write a Swift actor for thread-safe cache access."

Expected behavior: Do not prioritize `platform-frontend`; choose a more relevant skill or proceed without it.

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Does Not Trigger

- Error: The skill is not selected when expected.
- Cause: Request wording does not clearly match the description trigger conditions.
- Solution: Rephrase with explicit domain/task keywords from the description and retry.

### Guidance Conflicts With Another Skill

- Error: Instructions from multiple skills conflict in one task.
- Cause: Overlapping scope across loaded skills.
- Solution: State which skill is authoritative for the current step and apply that workflow first.

### Output Is Too Generic

- Error: Result lacks concrete, actionable detail.
- Cause: Task input omitted context, constraints, or target format.
- Solution: Add specific constraints (environment, scope, format, success criteria) and rerun.

## Workflow

1. Identify whether the request clearly matches `platform-frontend` scope and triggers.
2. Apply the skill rules and referenced guidance to produce a concrete result.
3. Validate output quality against constraints; if gaps remain, refine once with explicit assumptions.

## Project Overrides

Before applying rules from this skill, check if `.claude/overrides/platform-frontend.md` exists.

- **If it does not exist**: Create it from the template below, then inform the user.
- **If it exists**: Read it and apply its instructions over the defaults in this skill.
  Override file instructions take priority over upstream rules.

### Override Template

When creating the override file, use this content:

    # Platform Frontend — Project Overrides
    #
    # This file customizes the upstream platform-frontend skill for this project.
    # Edit freely — this file is never overwritten by skill updates.
    #
    # ## How to use
    # - **Disable a rule**: "Ignore the <rule-name> rule"
    # - **Modify a rule**: "For <rule-name>, instead do <your preference>"
    # - **Add a rule**: Write your project-specific rule directly
    #
    # Leave sections empty or delete them if you have no overrides.
