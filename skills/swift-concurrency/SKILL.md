# Swift Concurrency Patterns

Expert guidance on Swift Concurrency best practices covering async/await, actors, tasks, Sendable, threading, memory management, testing, and migration strategies.

## References

See [references/swift-concurrency.md](references/swift-concurrency.md) for comprehensive guidance organized by:

- **Async/Await Fundamentals** - Core patterns, error handling, parallel execution
- **Tasks & Structured Concurrency** - Task lifecycle, cancellation, task groups
- **Actors & Isolation** - Actor isolation, suspension points, state safety
- **Sendable & Data Safety** - Sendable conformance, data races, safe captures
- **Threading & Execution** - Execution contexts, isolation domains
- **Memory Management** - Retain cycles, weak references, task lifecycle
- **Testing Concurrency** - Async test patterns, Swift Testing integration
- **Migration & Interop** - Strict concurrency migration, legacy interop
