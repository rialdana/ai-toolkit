## Specify Output Format

Define the exact structure, length, and sections of the expected output.

**Incorrect (vague format):**

```markdown
Give me a summary of this article. Make it useful.
```

**Correct (format specified):**

```markdown
Summarise the article in exactly three sections:

1. **Key Findings** - 3-5 bullet points, one sentence each
2. **Methodology** - one paragraph (50-80 words) describing the research approach
3. **Implications** - 2-3 bullet points on practical takeaways for product managers

Use markdown with H3 headings for each section.
```

**Why it matters:** "Make it useful" is not actionable. Specifying sections, lengths, and formatting gives the AI a concrete target. The output is predictable and matches expectations on the first attempt instead of requiring iterative refinement.
